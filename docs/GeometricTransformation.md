# **Geometric Transformation**

## Rotation & Translation

Rotation is when you rotate an image by a certain angle around a fixed point, such as the center or a corner of the image. Translation is when you shift an image by a certain distance along the horizontal or vertical direction

## Affin Transformation

An image can be altered by the Affine Transformation process, which uses a series of linear correlations between the coordinates of the pixel in the source image and the corresponding coordinates in the output image. When an Affine Transformation is applied, every parallel line in the source image remains parallel in the resultant image. Scaling, translations, and rotations are among the operations it may convey. A 2x3 matrix is used to illustrate this transformation.
