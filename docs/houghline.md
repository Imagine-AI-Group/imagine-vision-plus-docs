# **Hough Line**

Represent each straight line in an image as a point in a parameter space, typically known as the Hough space or parameter space and this allows the detection of lines even in the presence of noise, gaps in the lines, or variations in line thickness

## Hough Line Normal

The edge detection algorithm used before finding lines in an image considers the overall intensity change in the image, rather than just the dominant direction of change

## Hough Line Probablilistic

Focuses on detecting edges based on the intensity differences between neighboring pixels
