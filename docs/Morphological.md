# **Morphological**

## **BlackHat**

Modifies the shape and size of objects in an image by highlighting the dark regions that are smaller than the structuring element and seen as a filter that enhances the contrast of an image.

## **Closing**

used to smooth the contours of objects, eliminate small holes, and connect disjointed parts and useful for noise removal, edge detection, and object recognition

## **Dilation**

To apply a morphological operation to an image that enlarges the size of the foreground object and sliding a structuring element, such as a circle or a square, over the image and replacing each pixel with the maximum value of its neighbors that are covered by the structuring element

## **Erosion**

Apply a morphological operation to an image that reduces the size of the foreground object and sliding a structuring element, such as a circle or a square, over the image and replacing each pixel with the minimum value of its neighbors that are covered by the structuring element

## **MorphologicalGradient**

type of morphological operation that modifies the shape and size of objects in an image by subtracting the eroded image from the dilated image and to find the outline of an object
