# **EdgeDetection**

## Canny

process of finding the boundaries of objects or regions in an image, which are often characterized by sharp changes in intensity or color and can be used for noise reduction,gradient calculation,double thresholding,edge tracking

## Sobel

uses a discrete differentiation operator to compute the gradient of the image intensity function and consists of applying two 3x3 kernels, one for horizontal changes and one for vertical changes, to the original image using a convolution operation
