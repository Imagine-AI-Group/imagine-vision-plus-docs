# **blur**

## boxblur

To apply a simple and fast blurring effect to an image and each pixel in the image with the average color of its neighboring pixels within a certain radius

## boxfilter

To apply a simple and fast smoothing effect to an image and each pixel in the image with the weighted average color of its neighboring pixels within a certain radius

## gaussian

apply a realistic and natural-looking blurring effect to an image and replacing each pixel in the image with the weighted average color of its neighboring pixels within a certain radius, where the weights follow a Gaussian distribution

## median

apply a noise-reducing and edge-preserving blurring effect to an image and replacing each pixel in the image with the median color of its neighboring pixels within a certain radius

## Unsharp Mask

apply a realistic and natural-looking blurring effect to an image and subtracting a blurred version of the image from the original image, and then adding the result to the original image
